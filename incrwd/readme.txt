== Description ==

Incrwd is a powerful yet incredibly simple loyalty program for blogs that uses real rewards to incentivize users to visit your site, share your posts on Facebook and Twitter, and comment more often. Users start earning points towards their rewards immediately, and are gradually motivated to register in order to keep their accumulated points.
