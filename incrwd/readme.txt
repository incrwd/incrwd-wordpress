== Description ==

Incrwd is a powerful yet incredibly simple loyalty program that uses real rewards to incentivize users to visit your site, share your posts on Facebook and Twitter, and comment more often. Users start earning points towards their rewards immediately, and are slowly motivated to register in order to keep their accumulated points. Offer your users giftcards from awesome brands provided by us, or create your own giveaways and upload your own personalized rewards. 

Increase your pageviews, time spent on site, social shares, comments, facebook likes, and decrease your bounce rate with our powerful loyalty program.

1) Registering to your wordrpess blog (or registering through facebook). 
2) Visiting the site on a weekly basis
2) Sharing articles and posts onto Facebook and Twitter
3) Commenting on articles. 
4) Liking your Facebook Page

1) Set your own personalized rewards (or use our own)
2) See in-depth analytics of how our widget is affecting user behavior.
