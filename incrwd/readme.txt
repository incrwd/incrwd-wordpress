Incrwd is a powerful yet incredibly simple engagement program for blogs that helps increase pageviews, visits, shares, and comments. 

== Description ==

Incrwd is a powerful yet incredibly simple engagement program for blogs that uses real rewards to incentivize users to visit your site, share your posts on Facebook and Twitter, and comment more often. Users start earning points towards their rewards immediately, and are gradually motivated to register in order to keep their accumulated points. Offer your users giftcards from awesome brands provided by us, or create your own giveaways and upload your own personalized rewards.
